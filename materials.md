## History of material science

3500BC - we discovered that we can combine copper and tin to create bronz
Iron age - Steel combine iron and carbon - carbon concentration was hard, too little hard to morph but too much it becomes too hard but brittle

First synthetic material was Bakelite - polymer 

ones before were Ivory used for pool balls and buttons or shellac (lacbug) had to be scraped by bug to coat electrical cables

Solar panels and space suits all revolutionary materials. Space suit boots inspired shock absorbant sneakers.

4 categories
1. Metals
    - Ferrous: Iron, steel and cast iron - iron is plentiful in earth crusts
    - Non-Ferrous: alumnium, copper, zinc, titanium, nickel
2. Polymers like plastics
    - natural: amber, wool, cellulose and natural rubber
    - synthetic: rubber, nylon, polysterene, silicon
3. Ceramics: glass and clay, clay was the first we figured out how to use
4. Composites: reinforced concrete steel bars with concrete 

Metals have good electrothermic properties, ductile, strong, tough and strong at temperatures

Polymers are organic carbons are made from hydrocarbons byproduct of oil (like factorio). Produce long chains, versatile and easily processed

Ceramics: semi conductors, when cooled 100% efficiency in conductivity. current cables lose 5% due to resistance in cables. Can be crystalline, non or hybrid
Light weight, hard, heat resistance but they can be brittle

Composites: Matrix or binder and reinforcement
* Concrete: Cement + stone aggregate reinforcement
* Fiber glass: Plastic + Glass strands
* Carbon fiber: Fibers of carbon + plastic

Fiber glass and carbon fiber are both stronger than steel but are transparent and maleable respectively

Metals atoms are arranged in orderly manner crystalline structure. Strength of 20K Megapascale but gets severely reduced with imperfections in the steel

Alloying makes metals stronger and distort them which makes it more difficult for atoms to move
