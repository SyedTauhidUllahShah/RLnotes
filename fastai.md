# Cool stuff I learned

* Callbacks that trigger on certain model events like epoch started or model fit done
* Pipeline: setting up multiple functions in sequence to preprocess data
* Data Cleaner Ipython widget
* Everything is a matrix multiplication - even LSTMs just have either matri multiplication or a linear layer
* Using path variables as a index for images
* Tabular data can be all combined with multiple embeddings to go into a deep neural network
* 1 cycle: rotate learning rates in a cyclical way
* Using bing images to get free image datasets
* torch.unsqueeze as a generalization of transpose
